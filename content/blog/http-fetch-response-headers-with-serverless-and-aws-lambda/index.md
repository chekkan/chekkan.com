In order to access response headers such as `Location` in HTTP Fetch api whilst using Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda Functions with CORS enabled, you need to do the following.

1. Make sure `cors` is set to `true` on `serverless.yml`

   ```yaml
   postUsers:
     handler: handler.postUsers
     events:
       - http:
         path: users
         method: post
         cors: true
   ```

1. Make sure in the response header, you are returning the following:
   ```javascript
   callback(null, {
     statusCode: 201,
     headers: {
       "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
       // Required for cookies, authorization headers with HTTPS
       "access-control-allow-credentials": true,
       "access-control-allow-headers": "Location",
       "access-control-expose-headers": "Location",
       Location: id
     }
   });
   ```

Now, you can access the header `location` from `fetch`.

```javascript
this.httpClient
  .fetch("/users", {
    method: "post",
    body: json({ username: "chekkan" })
  })
  .then(res => {
    return res.headers.get("location");
  });
```
